  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
This API enables Web content to initiate payment or issue a refund for a
product or service. Once implemented in the browser, an author may issue
<code>navigator.transact.pay()</code> function to initiate a payment.
  </p>
  <section class="informative">
    <h2>How to Read this Document</h2>

    <p>This document is a detailed specification for an application programming
      interface (API) for initiating payments from within a browser
      environment. The document is primarily intended for the following
      audiences:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Software developers who want to understand the design decisions and
        algorithms behind the API.</li>
      <li>Software developers who want to implement the API.</li>
    </ul>

 <h1>WebPayments Architecture</h1>
 <p>
An open web app will interact with a
<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/WebPaymentProvider">Payment Provider</a>
via <code>navigator.transact.pay()</code> and receive notifications POSTed to its
server about the result of each payment. Users will see a payment flow hosted
by the Payment Provider in a special window on the device.
 </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Payment Flow Overview</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
The app initiates a payment by signing a JSON Web Token [[!JWT]] request
and calling <code>navigator.transact.pay()</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
This starts the buyflow in a content iframe inside a trusted dialog
("chrome dialog").
      </li>
      <li>
A purchasing flow is served from the
<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/WebPaymentProvider">Payment Provider</a>'s
server as an HTML5 document inside the trusted dialog.
      </li>
      <li>
The buyer is authenticated by the
<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/WebPaymentProvider">Payment Provider</a>
(via the network, Mozilla Persona assertion or whatever authentication
mechanisms the Payment Provider chooses).
      </li>
      <li>
The buyer completes or cancels the purchase.
      </li>
      <li>
The app receives a Javascript callback when the buyer completes or cancels
the purchase.
      </li>
      <li>
The app server receives a signed POST request with a Payment Provider
transaction identifier indicating that the purchase was completed
successfully (or it failed).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

 Describe high-level payment flow, which is based on Mozilla's
 <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Apps/Publishing/In-app_payments">initial implementation for Firefox OS</a>.

      <h3>Sign-in</h3>
      <p>
This is an implementation detail of the <tref>Payment Provider</tref>.
The <code>navigator.transact.pay()</code> API does not prescribe any user
authorization scheme.

      <h3>Developer Registration</h3>
      <p>
This is an implementation detail of the <tref>Payment Provider</tref>.
The <code>navigator.transact.pay()</code> API facilities two parties in making a
transaction: 1) a Developer and 2) a Payment Provider.  It does not
facilitate any part of the registration process.
      </p>
      <p>
A developer who creates a JSON Web Token [[!JWT]] must do so with an
<tref>Application Secret</tref> obtained from the
<tref>Payment Provider</tref>.
      </p>
      <p class="issue">
In <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Apps/Publishing/In-app_payments">Mozilla's implementation</a>,
a developer signs up through the <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/developers/">Firefox Marketplace Developer Hub</a>,
enters bank account details for payouts, obtains an
<tref>Application Key</tref> and <tref>Application Secret</tref>, and can
begin signing JWTs for purchase.

      <h3>Initiating a Payment</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
The <tref>User</tref> opens an <tref>Application</tref>.</li>
        <li>
The user finds something interesting to purchase. Let's say it's a game and
the user wants to purchase a Magical Unicorn to excel in the game.
        </li>
        <li>
The user clicks a <strong>Buy Unicorn</strong> button.
        </li>
        <li>
The <tref>Application</tref> server responds by first signing a
JSON Web Token [[!JWT]] using its <tref>Application Secret</tref>.
The JWT is a base64-encoded signed JSON object. The JSON contains all the
details about the product such as name, description, price, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
The <tref>Application</tref> bubbles up the JWT to the client and calls
<code>navigator.transact.pay([theJWT])</code>. This begins the hosted buy flow
within a special window on the <tref>User Agent</tref>.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
Here is a detailed explanation of the payment JWT:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>iss (mandatory)</dt>
        <dd>
The issuer of the JWT. This is the Application Key assigned
during the app registration process for this specific payment provider
(e.g. Marketplace).
        </dd>
        <dt>typ (mandatory)</dt>
        <dd>
The JWT type. This identifies the payment provider, e.g.
Marketplace, and the JWT version that must be supported by the provider.
On the User Agent, typ is used to look up white-listed Payment Providers.
        </dd>
        <dt>iat (mandatory)</dt>
        <dd>
Issued at time. This is a UTC Unix timestamp of when the JWT was issued.
        </dd>
        <dt>exp (mandatory)</dt>
        <dd>
Expiration. A UTC Unix timestamp of when the JWT should expire.
        </dd>
        <dt>nbf (optional)</dt>
        <dd>
Not-before time. A UTC Unix timestamp of the earliest time the JWT can
be processed.
        </dd>
        <dt>request (mandatory)</dt>
        <dd>
          <dl>
            <dt>pricePoint (mandatory)</dt>
            <dd>
An identifier that corresponds to a price according to the Payment Provider.
For example, pricePoint 1 might translate into €0,89 when the buyer is in
Europe or $0.99 when in the US, etc. The exact price point values are
managed by the Payment Provider and they may change based on currency
exchange rates.
            <dt>name (mandatory)</dt>
            <dd>
A short description of the product.
            </dd>
            <dt>description (mandatory)</dt>
            <dd>
A long description of the product.
            </dd>
            <dt>id (mandatory)</dt>
            <dd>
A unique identifier for the product you are selling. This only needs
to be unique within your own catalog, not unique among all products from all
apps.
            </dd>
            <dt>productData (optional)</dt>
            <dd>
A freeform string, no longer than 255 characters. This can be
anything the app might need to identify the product with when a postback
is sent back to the app.
            </dd>
            <dt>postbackURL (mandatory)</dt>
            <dd>
URL where the payment processor sends an HTTP POST message to
whenever a purchase completes. The application server needs to acknowledge
these POST messages, or else the transactions will be canceled.
            </dd>
            <dt>chargebackURL (mandatory)</dt>
            <dd>
URL where the payment processor sends an HTTP POST message to
whenever a refund associated with this transaction is done.
            </dd>
          </dl>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
For a user to make a purchase, the Application must execute the Javascript
method <code>navigator.transact.pay()</code> with one or more signed payment
requests (the JWTs). For example, the app might have a 'buy' button that
triggers this method when clicked. Then <code>navigator.transact.pay()</code> method
should take the signed payment JWT or an array of them. It will return a
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/DOMRequest">DOMRequest</a> object
that the developer can use to monitor the progress of the operation.
      </p>

      <pre class="example" title="Initiating a payment via the navigator.transact.pay() method">
var request = navigator.transact.pay([signedJWT1, signedJWTn]);

request.onsuccess = function () {
  // The payment buy flow completed without errors.
  // This does NOT mean the payment was successful.
  waitForServerPostback();
}

request.onerror = function (errorMsg) {
  console.log('navigator.transact.pay() error: ' + this.error.name + ': ' + errorMsg);
}
      </pre>

      <ol>
        <li>
The <code>navigator.transact.pay</code> method will open a payment request
confirmation screen based on the received JWTs, so the user can confirm and
choose the payment method that is more appropriate for him.
The User Agent would only
show the payment providers for the JWT <strong>typ</strong> values that are
pre-registered in the User Agent. JWTs containing a <strong>typ</strong>
value not registered in the UA would be considered as invalid.
        </li>
        <li>
Once the user selects a Payment Provider the UA will open a special window
(a "chrome" dialog) containing the Payment Provider's buy flow that is
registered in the User Agent for the <strong>typ</strong> value of the
passed JWT.
        </li>
        <li>
Why an array of JWTs? The Developer will have a specific contract with
each Payment Provider and will have a unique Application Secret for each
provider. When a payment is initiated, the Application must send all JWTs.
The user will select only one Payment Provider to complete the purchase. If
there is only one JWT to choose from, the user will automatically use that
Payment Provider.
        </li>
        <li>
The details of the exact buy flow are implemented by the
<tref>Payment Provider</tref>. In Mozilla's pay flow, the user logs in via
Persona, enters a PIN, and is presented with details about the item to be
purchased.
        </li>
        <li>
The user confirms the purchase or cancels it.
        </li>
        <li>
If the user cancels or something goes wrong with the payment process, the
flow returns to the <code>DOMRequest.onerror</code> callback.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Notifications</h3>
      <p>
The Application must only rely on server side notifications to determine the
outcome of a purchase. The Payment Provider will POST a confirmation message
(a JWT) to the <strong>postbackURL</strong> (on success) or the
<strong>chargebackURL</strong> (on error). The Application provides these
URLs in the original JWT request.
      </p>
      <p>
The POST request will have a content-type of
<code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> and the JWT will be in the
<strong>notice</strong> form parameter. This JWT contains a copy of the
original payment request plus a new response object that has a
<strong>transactionID</strong> which identifies the Payment Provider's
transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
When a JWT is received, the Application first needs to verify the signature
using its Application Secret. If the signature is not valid, it probably was
not sent from the Payment Provider and should be ignored. If the signtature
is valid, then the application server should decode the JWT, record it, and
<strong>respond with a 200 OK that contains the transactionID in plain
text</strong>. If the Application server responds with an error status or
does not respond with the right transactionID, the Payment Provider will
consider this a failure. It will retry and/or notify the Developer about the
failure. The Application must respond to the request in plain text containing
just the <strong>transactionID</strong> value.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h4>Postback</h4>
        <p>
Here is an example of a JWT POSTed via the <strong>notice</strong> parameter
to <strong>postbackURL</strong> that indicates a transaction was fully
processed and was successful:
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="Postback example">
{
   "iss": "marketplace.firefox.com",
   "aud": APPLICATION_KEY,
   "typ": "mozilla/payments/pay/postback/v1",
   "exp": 1337370900,
   "iat": 1337360900,
   "request": {
     "id": "915c07fc-87df-46e5-9513-45cb6e504e39",
     "pricePoint": 1,
     "name": "Magical Unicorn",
     "description": "Adventure Game item",
     "productData": "user_id=1234&amp;my_session_id=XYZ",
     "postbackURL": "https://yourapp.com/payments/postback",
     "chargebackURL": "https://yourapp.com/payments/chargeback"
   },
   "response": {
     "transactionID": "webpay:84294ec6-7352-4dc7-90fd-3d3dd36377e9"
   }
 }
        </pre>
        <p>Here is an example response that includes just the transactionID:

        <pre class="example" title="HTTP Response for postback example">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain

webpay:84294ec6-7352-4dc7-90fd-3d3dd36377e9
        </pre>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Chargeback</h4>
        <p>
Here is an example of a JWT POSTed via the <strong>notice</strong> parameter
to <strong>chargebackURL</strong> that indicates a transaction was fully
processed but was unsuccessful:
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="Chargeback example">
{
  "iss": "marketplace.firefox.com",
  "aud": APPLICATION_KEY,
  "typ": "mozilla/payments/pay/chargeback/v1",
  "exp": 1337370900,
  "iat": 1337360900,
  "request": {
    "id": "915c07fc-87df-46e5-9513-45cb6e504e39",
    "pricePoint": 1,
    "name": "Magical Unicorn",
    "description": "Adventure Game item",
    "productData": "user_id=1234&amp;my_session_id=XYZ",
    "postbackURL": "https://yourapp.com/payments/postback",
    "chargebackURL": "https://yourapp.com/payments/chargeback"
  },
  "response": {
    "transactionID": "webpay:84294ec6-7352-4dc7-90fd-3d3dd36377e9",
    "reason": "refund"
  }
}
        </pre>

        <p>
A chargeback JWT might be received instead of or in addition to a postback.
The response will contain a <strong>reason</strong> attribute, as follows:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>refund</dt>
          <dd>
The payment was refunded either upon request of the customer or by an
administrator.
          </dd>
          <dt>reversal</dt>
          <dd>
A buyer has asked the credit card issuer to reverse a transaction after it
has been completed. The buyer might do this through the credit card company
as part of a dispute.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
Here is an example response that includes just the transactionID:
        </p>

        <pre class="example" title="HTTP response for chargeback example">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain

webpay:84294ec6-7352-4dc7-90fd-3d3dd36377e9

        <h4>Refunds</h4>
        <p>
Refunds are not yet supported by the <code>navigator.transact.pay()</code> API.
<strong>At a future date, an Application may be able to request a refund
like this</strong>:
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="Refund example">
{
  "iss": APPLICATION_KEY,
  "aud": "marketplace.firefox.com",
  "typ": "mozilla/payments/refund/v1",
  "exp": 1337370900,
  "iat": 1337360900,
  "request": {
    "transactionID": "webpay:84294ec6-7352-4dc7-90fd-3d3dd36377e9",
    "reason": "User requested refund",
    "chargebackURL": "https://yourapp.com/payments/chargeback"
  }
}
        </pre>
        <p>
This would initiate a refund flow and POST a confirmation JWT when completed.

  <h1>Payment Provider facing API</h1>
  <p class="issue">
Figure out how to reference the
<a href="/WebAPI/WebPaymentProvider" title="WebAPI/WebPaymentProvider">WebPaymentProvider</a>
spec for details on how to implement a payment provider for
<code>navigator.transact.pay()</code>. It may be that we need to fold that into this
spec.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Application Programming Interface</h2>

  <p>This API provides a clean mechanism that enables developers to 
    initiate payments in a Web Agent. A conformant Payment Initator
    MUST implement the entirety of the following API.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>NavigatorTransactions</h3>

    <p>Navigator Transactions is the name of the high-level programming 
      interface that Web developers use to initiate payments. If MUST be
      made available via the <code>navigator.transact</code> object.</p>

    <dl title="interface NavigatorTransactions" class="idl">
      <dt>DOMRequest pay()</dt>
      <dd>
        Initiates a payment or refund given an array of JSON Web Tokens [[!JWT]]
        describing the types of actions to perform.

        <dl class="parameters">
          <dt>object[] requests</dt>
          <dd>An array of JSON Web Tokens [[!JWT]] describing the type
          of payment operations to perform.</dd>
        </dl>
      </dd>
      <dt>DOMRequest registerProvider()</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
Registers a payment provider with the browser such that future 
transactions may provide an interface to the user to select 
which payment provider that they would like to use to complete a
transaction.
        </p> 
        <p>
Registering a payment provider can alter the choices given to the User when a
transaction is processed. In the worst case, an attacker could register a fake 
payment provider that collects all of the User's credit card or banking details. 
In order to ensure that the User is protected from this sort of attack, the 
User Agent MUST provide a special interface that is not easily spoofed by 
an attacker.
        </p>

        <p class="issue">
We may want to place a number of restrictions on sites
doing the registration, such as: 1) The call must be done on a page served over
TLS and with no scripts loaded from a non-secure channel. 2) The domain for the
<code>id</code> and <code>services</code> URLs must match the domain 
for the page requesting the registration, etc.
        </p>

        <dl class="parameters">
          <dt>object provider</dt>
          <dd>An object consisting of the following keys and values:
            <dl style="margin-left: 1em;">
              <dt><code>id</code> (optional)<dt>
              <dd>A URL identifier for the provider.</dd>
              <dt><code>type</code><dt>
              <dd>
                <p>
The type of payments supported by the payment provider. Valid values include:
<code>MozPay</code>, <code>CreditCard</code>, <code>ACH</code>, 
<code>PayPal</code>, <code>AmazonPayments</code>, 
<code>GoogleWallet</code>, <code>PaySwarm</code>.
                </p>
                <p class="issue">
Most of these types don't make sense as they're not
interoperable with any other system and don't have a protocol for notifying
sites that a payment has been made successfully. We may just want to make
this a free-form string and let payment providers and merchants settle on
interoperable values.
                </p>
              </dd>
              <dt><code>services</code> (optional)<dt>
              <dd>
A URL that can be used to determine more information about the payment provider
Web service endpoints by the User Agent or Merchant.
              </dd>
            </dl>
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </dd>
      <dt>DOMRequest getProviders()</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
Retrieves all of the payment providers that are registered with the User Agent 
that match the query criteria given and were authorized to be included in
the response by the User.
        </p>
        <p>
It is not always preferable for a User to have all of their payment providers
exposed to a Merchant. In the worst case, an attacker can use this information
to execute spear-fishing attacks against the User. The User Agent should 
provide the User with an interface that allows them to select which providers 
they want to expose to the merchant. In many cases, the User will only want to
expose one, which will make the purchase process proceed more fluidly. 
        </p>
        <p>
The result will be an array of payment providers that are in the same format
as the objects passed to the <code>registerProvider()</code> method.
        </p>
      
        <dl class="parameters">
          <dt>string[] query</dt>
          <dd>
An array of payment provider types that are supported by the merchant.
          </dd>
        </dl>
